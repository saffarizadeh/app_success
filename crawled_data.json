Get ready to open your heart to find love.\n\nDiscover quality people\nZoosk is a relationship app with one goal\u2014to help people connect and find romantic love. Rather than flings, Zoosk helps real people find the real love they\u2019re looking for through a number of different means. Use the Carousel feature, which gamifies the dating experience so you can swipe through profiles, or turn on SmartPick\u2122 and we\u2019ll show you people you\u2019d connect best with. If you find someone cute, you can subscribe to message them and talk instantly. With 3 million messages sent daily between Zoosk members, it\u2019s no wonder so many men and women find what they\u2019re looking for. Say goodbye to wasting time on dates only to learn the other person doesn\u2019t share the same values as you do.\n\nAdvanced search filters\nSort through the millions of potentials out there and match with your perfect soulmate using Zoosk\u2019s advanced search filters. Not only can you set your preferences at signup, like sexual preferences such as lesbian, gay or straight, but members can refine their search based on age and location. Zoosk takes this one step further by letting members search in even more detail, such as relationship history, children, ethnicity, religion, education and body type.\n\nOnline to real life \u2013 Meet nearby singles\nWhat if we told you that your future partner could be living just a few blocks from your house, or that you worked at the same company but never knew it? Zoosk offers you multiple ways to meet new people living in your area. Filtering matches based on location means you can match with someone at your local coffee shop, and go on a romantic date to talk more after work. Location is everything!\n\nSafe and secure \nZoosk knows that people\u2019s top concern when searching for love online is safety. As the first relationship app to verify member photos using human moderators, Zoosk\u2019s Photo Verification feature ensures members are genuine. Zoosk also verifies people\u2019s phone numbers and social media accounts, and the Insignia\u2122 feature lets users submit proof they\u2019ve served in the U.S. armed forces, which helps us remove dishonest users from our community. \n\nNo more wasting time and energy, and definitely no more playing around. Download Zoosk and get ready, because eternal love is just a click away.

This can be any Roku Streaming Player, Roku Stick or Roku TV (from Hisense, TCL, Insignia and Sharp)! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Roku.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Roku. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Roku app. It will start looking for your Roku(s) on your local network. When a Roku Player, Stick or TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, your Roku will go to the Mirror for Roku install page. Select Add Channel to add the Mirror for Roku receiver on your Roku.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your Roku is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the Roku that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Roku app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n1. Audio\n- When screen mirroring from Safari, there is no audio. We advice to use the Dolphin Mobile Browser (free on the App Store) instead of Safari.\n- Sometimes audio from other apps is not playing. In this case, start a screen mirroring session, then open the app you want to mirror. If there is no sound, just close the app you are mirroring and re-open it in the same mirroring session.\n\n2. DRM\nSome apps don't allow screen mirroring. For instance Netflix: when you start screen mirroring when running the Netflix app on your iPhone or iPad, the TV screen will turn black. This is a choice that Netflix made, there is nothing that we can do about that.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Worked great!\" - 5 STARS - by HeatherWorky\nSure there is a slight delay, but I just turn down the audio on my iPhone and it\u2019s fine. Works perfectly. Was about to pitch my roku but now I can use it with Spotify and other accounts. Thanks!\n\n\"Love it !!! Thank you developers\" - 5 STARS - by Kenjikaea\nIt works smoothly for me currently on a iPhone X no lag at all I can watch movies play apps from my smart tv .\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv", "bundleId": "tv.airbeam.mirrorforrokuios", "averageUserRating": 2.5,

creates a unique adventure for each new hero of legend in the relentless fight against the evil Mormo. Explore a delightful but dangerous overworld, brave menacing dungeons, and improve your hero in a charming village, during your quest to overcome the evil that plagues the island. Unleash the mystical Sword of Ditto for an unforgettable adventure filled with delightful characters, extraordinary loot, and heroic battles!\n\nUnique Adventures Linked Together: Each adventure becomes its own legend, both distinct from those that came before it and part of a heroic legacy that bind together. The deeds, successes, and failures of each hero's adventure have implications for those that follow including the ability to find weapons and recover loot from history\u2019s fallen heroes.\n\nWeapons, Items, & Stickers: Wield the traditional sword and bow combo alongside the decidedly less traditional vinyl record Frisbee, magic golf club, and colossal foot from the heavens to put Mormo and her legions back on their heels. Collect and equip stickers to boost up your hero and add perks to their gear to become powerful enough to banish the wicked sorceress. \n\nMain Quests and Secret Side Missions: Approach your legend however you see fit by battling through dungeons in any order, completing side missions through dark caverns and deep wells, or confront Mormo right from the start for the ultimate challenge.",

No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app or content on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\n1. First of all, make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n2. Open \"Settings\" on your iPhone/iPad, then tap \"Control Center\". \n3. For iPhone: please turn on \"Access Within Apps\", then tap \"Customize Controls\". For iPad: please tap \"Customize Controls\". \n4. Scroll down and look for \"Screen Recording\" from the \"MORE CONTROLS\" list. Then tap the green '+' button to add the \"Screen Recording\" control to the \"INCLUDE\" list. \n5. On iPhone X / XS / XR, swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen to open \"Control Center\". On iPhone/iPad, swipe up from the bottom edge of the screen to open \"Control Center\", then Long Press / Force Press / 3D Touch the \"Screen Recording\" control (NOT \"Screen Mirroring\") to open the app list. \n6. Scroll up/down and find \"Smart Mirror\" in the list, then select it and tap \"Start Broadcast\". \n\nFEATURES:\n\n\u2022 Mirror your iPhone/iPad screen to your Samsung TVs or devices. \n\u2022 Supports Samsung TVs, Samsung Blu-ray players, and various Samsung devices (manufactured in 2012 and later). \n\u2022 Supports both portrait and landscape orientations for screen mirroring. \n\u2022 Consumes fewer resources, so your iPhone/iPad won't run slowly during screen mirroring.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n\u2022 You will experience a latency (usually between 1 and 5 seconds) on your TV screen during mirroring; it is impossible to achieve zero-second latency which makes it unsuitable for gaming. However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\u2022 DRM-protected content can't be mirrored, e.g., Netflix video.\n\u2022 Video stream only, no sound.", "bundleId": "com.sensustech.smartmirror", "averageUserRating": 2.5, "userRatingCount": 325}, "1406710800": {"artistViewUrl":

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nPlease also note that while you can use almost any language on your cards, AnkiMobile's user interface is only available in English and Simplified Chinese at the moment.\n\nAside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.", "bundleId": "net.ichi2.anki", "averageUserRating": 4.0, "userRatingCount": 1263}, "890378044": {"isGameCenterEnabled": false, "screenshotUrls": ["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/61/6d/1e/616d1e07-949c-48d8-94d1-ae4d9890775a/mzl.olomjdzy.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a8/a9/16/a8a9164d-0e00-d870-efbd-1a4b5c0eda2c/mzl.xtavjxsw.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/52/fd/42/52fd42a4-c49b-9b81-2da3-c6ce88e5c19e/mzl.sqhyyqym.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/2b/97/b6/2b97b62f-3b19-2589-5d2b-ee66f8c28805/mzl.liizhlov.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/80/ee/dc/80eedcdd-b71a-6be6-5f5a-71c9d8cfe09d/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"], "ipadScreenshotUrls": ["https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/73/a4/e7/73a4e703-49cd-a2c8-8381-a03ac1c6c5d3/mzl.cokthdwv.png/576x768bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/0d/0c/c1/0d0cc1a0-6a8b-4681-38c2-21f75c134ef2/mzl.nidgqmol.png/576x768bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a2/d3/5e/a2d35e49-6f3f-b98f-2dcd-ef4d9052ce45/mzl.ydcbyxhu.png/576x768bb.png", "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/2f/1d/21/2f1d210e-afd7-eebd-e157-7df3ce275930/mzl.limldizj.png/576x768bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/8a/f3/b2/8af3b234-3c1f-de95-8883-16c9d4345aba/pr_source.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"], "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/78/01/94/78019479-5e96-ff64-26cd-b06f1dc22e0d/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl512": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/78/01/94/78019479-5e96-ff64-26cd-b06f1dc22e0d/source/512x512bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/78/01/94/78019479-5e96-ff64-26cd-b06f1dc22e0d/source/100x100bb.jpg", "artistViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/peak-games/id476160947?uo=4", "appletvScreenshotUrls": [], "advisories": [], "supportedDevices": ["iPhone4-iPhone4", "iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi", "iPad23G-iPad23G", "iPhone4S-iPhone4S", "iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen", "iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G", "iPhone5-iPhone5", "iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen", "iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G", "iPadMini-iPadMini", "iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G", "iPhone5c-iPhone5c", "iPhone5s-iPhone5s", "iPadAir-iPadAir", "iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular", "iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina", "iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular", "iPhone6-iPhone6", "iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus", "iPadAir2-iPadAir2", "iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular", "iPadMini3-iPadMini3", "iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular", "iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen", "iPhone6s-iPhone6s", "iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus", "iPadMini4-iPadMini4", "iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular", "iPadPro-iPadPro", "iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular", "iPadPro97-iPadPro97", "iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular", "iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE", "iPhone7-iPhone7", "iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus", "iPad611-iPad611", "iPad612-iPad612", "iPad71-iPad71", "iPad72-iPad72", "iPad73-iPad73", "iPad74-iPad74", "iPhone8-iPhone8", "iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus", "iPhoneX-iPhoneX", "iPad75-iPad75", "iPad76-iPad76", "iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS", "iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax", "iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR", "iPad812-iPad812", "iPad834-iPad834", "iPad856-iPad856", "iPad878-iPad878", "iPadMini5-iPadMini5", "iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular", "iPadAir3-iPadAir3", "iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular", "iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen", "iPhone11-iPhone11", "iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro", "iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen", "iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular", "iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"], "kind": "software", "features": ["iosUniversal"], "trackCensoredName": "Toy Blast", "languageCodesISO2A": ["EN", "FR", "DE", "IT", "JA", "PT", "ES", "TR"], "fileSizeBytes": "389035008", "contentAdvisoryRating": "4+", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.0, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion": 123, "trackViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toy-blast/id890378044?uo=4", "trackContentRating": "4+", "trackId": 890378044, "trackName": "Toy Blast", "releaseNotes": "It's time for a new update with a fantastic journey! \n\n- PLAY 50 NEW LEVELS!

You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\n\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\n\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\n\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n1. Audio\n- When screen mirroring from Safari, there is no audio. We advice to use the Dolphin Mobile Browser (free on the App Store) instead of Safari.\n- Sometimes audio from other apps is not playing. In this case, start a screen mirroring session, then open the app you want to mirror. If there is no sound, just close the app you are mirroring and re-open it in the same mirroring session.\n\n2. DRM\nSome apps don't allow screen mirroring. For instance Netflix: when you start screen mirroring when running the Netflix app on your iPhone or iPad, the TV screen will turn black. This is a choice that Netflix made, there is nothing that we can do about that.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, \u201cBingo\u201d it works a treat.

With down-to-the-minute forecasts, you\u2019ll know exactly when the rain will start or stop, right where you\u2019re standing. (It\u2019s like magic.) \n\nFeatured in: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Wired, and more.\n\nYOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE \nDark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-by-minute predictions for the next hour and hour-by-hour forecasts for the next day and week.\n\nBEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS \nThe same technology that powers Dark Sky\u2019s predictions also allows us to make the world\u2019s first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Sky\u2019s radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where it\u2019s going in the future. \n\nPUSH NOTIFICATIONS \nDark Sky comes with advanced notification options: Receive down-to-the-minute alerts before it starts raining at your exact location, get notified of government severe weather alerts (for such things as thunderstorms, flooding, hurricanes, etc.), or even create your own custom notifications covering the next 24 hours for things like temperature, wind, precipitation and more.

Plus, 8, 8 Plus, X, XS, XR; iPad Mini 4, 5; iPad Air 2, 3; iPad Pro; iPod Touch 7th gen (2019)\n\nSimpleRockets 2 DOES NOT support: iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus; iPad Air, Mini 2, 3; iPod Touch 6th gen and lower\n\nSimpleRockets 2 is a fully 3D space sim that lets you build rockets, airplanes, rovers, or anything you can imagine and explore highly detailed 3D planets. Easily share crafts and saved games with the community. Included are 17 different challenges to put your creations to the test.\n\nBuild crafts by snapping parts together. Choose from the pre-built engines, such as the Mage, which is a powerful kerosene-fueled engine. Or choose the very weak, but highly efficient Ion Engine. Or you can dig deeper into the complexity of rocket science and design your own rocket engines. Choose from the eight available engine types, seven nozzles, and six fuel types. From there you can change engine size, nozzle length, throat radius, and more.\n\nUse interstages to split your craft into multiple stages and piece together modular fairings to protect your precious cargo. Launch multiple crafts into orbit. You can dock with your existing crafts to build space stations, moon bases, refueling stations, etc. \n\nResize and reshape fuel tanks, wings, cargo bays, fairings, and nose cones with easy-to-use tools that help you create exactly what you want. Resize solar panels, wheels, pistons, shocks, etc to fit your needs. Paint your craft custom colors and tweak their reflectiveness, emissiveness, and texture styles.\n\nOrbits are realistically simulated and support time-warp so you don't have to wait several months to reach another planet. The Map View makes it easy to see your orbits and plan future burns, which you can use to set up future encounters with other planets or satellites.\n\nThe flight model dynamically updates drag and lift characteristics of your craft as it changes. Re-entry effects kick in when you're screaming through an atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. Be careful, because the excessive heat can cause those aforementioned rapid unplanned disassemblies.\n\n\nDownload from a huge collection of user-uploaded crafts and sandboxes on our website. Upload your own crafts and sandboxes and share them with the community. Rise through the ranks from a white level builder to a gold level builder and beyond.\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Fully 3D Rocket Designer that allows building anything from basic rockets to very complicated multi-stage rockets, airplanes, rovers, satellites, robotic mechs, etc.\n* Design custom rocket engines and jet engines\n* Realistic rocket physics and orbital mechanics.\n* Over 30 parts, including fairings, retractable solar panels, rover wheels, engines, etc. \n* Highly procedural parts that can be resized and reshaped into endless combinations, such as the resizable fuel tank and the cargo bay.\n* Map View to navigate the solar system that displays predicted orbits and encounters. \n* Fully 3D, rotating planets that support water and multiple biomes, such as desert, grasslands, tundra, etc.\n* Persistent sandbox that retains your previous launches.\n* Players can upload their rockets and sandboxes and share them with other players. \n* Online community where players can upvote and comment on other players' content.\n* Several build and flight challenges.\n* Parts support textures, reflections, and custom coloring.\n* Flight model dynamically updates drag and lift characteristics of your craft as it changes.\n* Re-entry effects including visual effects and part damage from heat.\n* Custom Launch Locations allow launching from multiple places in the solar system.\n* Support for saving custom subassemblies.\n* Crafts can dock together in orbit and transfer fuel.\n* Built-in tutorials show you how to build a craft and how to achieve orbit.\n* Time-Warp allows fast-forwarding while in orbit.", "bundleId": "com.jundroo.SimpleRockets2", "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 296}, "540925164": {"screenshotUrls":

The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n\u2022  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n\u2022  Option to resume capture \n\u2022  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n\u2022  Innovative 'Freeze'  and \u2018Blur Strength\u2019 controls\n\u2022  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n\u2022  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n\u2022  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n\u2022  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

This is not a cheap voice effect, like every other voice changer on the market.\n\nIf you've tried voice changers in the past, you've probably encountered voice changers that simply change the pitch or speed of your voice, or put a horrible echo effect or \"dry\" your voice using a frequency gate or other very simple effect... That is not us, we are the real deal. Try our celebrity voice changer for yourself.\n\nFor the first time, you can say anything you want in English, and have it spoken back to you by a huge group of celebrity A-listers.\n\nTo use the app, make sure you have an Internet connection, then Tap and Speak into the microphone. It will automatically detect silence.  It should only take a few seconds at most to generate a video of your changed voice back to you. You can then share the video (which contains your changed voice).\n\nLegal Notice: ALL ORIGINAL CONTENT and ARTWORK - NO IMPLIED AFFILIATION or ENDORSEMENT - NO CELEBRITY NAMES or LIKENESS - IMPRESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PARODY - VOICES ARE ONLY IMPRESSIONS - NOT A SOUNDBOARD - Celebrity Voice Changer is meant to be used as a parody and to create parody. HatsOfApps is not claiming an affiliation with any celebrity who is being parodied. All content within Celebrity Voice Changer is original, and there are no Celebrity or Brand names; only our poor impressions. HatsOffApps uses user-generated content to create the technology and to create user-generated voice changer.\n\nFAQ:\n\n*Can I request a new voice?\n\nYes! Tweet it and ask us in your comments (we read them), we will focus on the most requested voices, so get your friends to request Voice Changer Voices too!\n\n*Sometimes it is perfect, but sometimes I don't understand what it is saying, can you make it better?\n\nYes, and we are working on it. Deep Learning Technology by our partner's technology automatically learns and does impressions of celebrity voices without any human training. The technology is not perfect yet, but we're getting there. With your support we will continue working until the voices are indistinguishable from human voice. We are also working on real-time voice changer technology in conjunction with our partner. Our technology makes it possible to change the voice, not just disguise the voice or change your voice to an FX chain that makes it sound like a monster or a chipmunk.\n\n*Can you do a particular celebrity voice?\n\nYes. We can do any voice. Our partner's technology is learning to do impressions of humans by listening to tens of thousands of hours of human speech. We use a proprietary neural network that turns a human voice into a voice font, or text to speech voice. In order for us to do impressions, we need audio to create celebrity voice impressions. Soon, we will make available our partner's community on our website and upload any voice impressions for us to use to make voices.\n\nFor licensing inquiries and API key requests, please reach out to

BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it\u2019s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we\u2019re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we\u2019re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today\u2019s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they\u2019re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that\u2019s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You\u2019ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone\u2019s personality. You\u2019ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we\u2019ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use.

All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.

For this new iOS version, we have added additional support to Siri Shortcuts, which makes Camera+ 2 a very powerful collaborative tool. Check out this blog post: https://camera.plus/blog/camera-2-introduction-to-shortcuts/ to get a more detailed explanation and some ideas on how to use it.\n\nOn the camera side we have added exposure clipping indicators, or zebra stripes. We have also improved portrait mode's ability to detect when your subject is a person in order to make it compatible with the iPhone XR. Please see the FAQ: http://camera.plus/faq for the full Portrait Mode compatibility list.\n\nIn the Lightbox now you have smart filters that allow you to see only those items that you want to deal with at a given moment.\n\nAdditionally, we made a video: https://youtu.be/rZdKzTt_cIw to showcase how photography has changed so much over the years, but the meaning behind, and passion for our photos has always been constant.

A complete rewrite of the original Camera+ that sold over 14 million copies, Camera+ 2 is better, faster and stronger than ever.\n\nA lot of things have happened in the 8 years since we first released the original Camera+. iPhone cameras have improved dramatically - not only in terms of sheer optical quality, but also in the array of technical and creative tools they provide. Manual controls, RAW capture, depth editing are a few of the capabilities whose presence in a mobile phone was unthinkable just a couple of years ago.\n\nWe decided it was time to rebuild Camera+ to prepare for the next 10 years of mobile photography. We rewrote everything from scratch to create a solid and modern foundation on which to incorporate the advances we'll see coming with every new iPhone release. The result of that effort is Camera+ 2, and we are incredibly proud of it. It preserves the personality of the classic app you love, and it will enable us to continue in our mission to provide you with the best and easiest to use tools to express your creativity and personality. We hope you like using Camera+ 2 as much as we loved creating it.\n\nHere are some of the best features in Camera+ 2.\n\nEverything Included\nCamera+ 2 supports and adapts to iPhone and iPad. Use the same shooting and editing tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features, filters and tools are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nManual Controls\nPhotographers that need absolute control over their shots can use Camera+ 2\u2019s advanced manual controls to select the precise settings they need. Shutter speed, ISO and White Balance can be selected using on-screen wheels and controls. In dual-lens devices, you can easily select Wide or Tele depending on your needs. The good thing about our manual controls is that they don't have to be present on-screen if you don't need them, so casual photographers are equally welcome.\n\nRAW Capture and Editing\nEnable RAW capture to get the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision, to get the maximum flexibility while editing. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop RAW images, or edit them on your computer with the tools you already use.\n\nDepth Capture and Editing\nIn compatible devices (those with dual cameras, currently the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X), a Depth-capture mode is available. When you enable depth capture in Camera+ 2, the depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab section of the editor can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Smile mode to allow Camera+ 2 to detect smiles and shoot for you, or the Stabilizer mode to shoot only when your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. The Slow Shutter mode provides you with the means to take long exposures, even in daylight. Burst and Timer modes complete our comprehensive offering of shooting modes for specialized purposes.\n\nBest Photo Library Integration\nCamera+ 2 editing tools can now be easily used on all the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between the Photo Library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button. Or use drag and drop gestures on the iPad to copy or share photos. Files and iTunes integration are also available, so you can easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nFaster and More Efficient\nAll-new editing tools rewritten from scratch take full advantage of the newest image processing technologies of iOS 11. We could discuss this at length but we think it suffices to say that we met our goal to make editing, sharing and exporting faster than ever.", "bundleId": "com.latenitesoft.CameraPlus2", "averageUserRating": 4.0, "userRatingCount": 964}, "930441707": {"screenshotUrls": ["https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/0b/df/02/0bdf021a-c42f-d03f-c940-db5d40d46ba1/mzl.boyrgtid.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c9/ab/99/c9ab99b4-9b5f-158d-7468-95def0effb3b/mzl.gakoqshf.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/cf/d6/52/cfd65248-c836-2354-af26-ad481d558943/mzl.xboonfdg.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e2/94/7b/e2947b58-b9ed-9c39-8c78-4df29e7d69e7/mzl.tfjgspaj.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/14/ff/d5/14ffd565-799b-68bb-f15a-9405c09234ed/mzl.amktxlag.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/9b/9a/1f/9b9a1f21-0cc8-ce0c-85ff-cec7abf99882/mzl.gncwefpb.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7f/57/90/7f579036-f6bc-09ea-e8be-4e48b31eacc0/mzl.wjdrdzcb.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c4/b3/49/c4b34930-a5c7-e8eb-4cb6-807d725ba863/mzl.pclucxzi.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/36/70/23/367023ce-66e0-032d-5592-8509b54812cd/mzl.mnqnwnxg.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/0f/77/20/0f7720c0-364b-7ae1-0c08-3dd1d8f03341/mzl.slsmxxrs.png/392x696bb.png"], "ipadScreenshotUrls": [], "appletvScreenshotUrls": [], "artworkUrl60": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5a/06/2d/5a062d79-c0cc-26d4-7942-6595a2a18e4b/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl512": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5a/06/2d/5a062d79-c0cc-26d4-7942-6595a2a18e4b/source/512x512bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5a/06/2d/5a062d79-c0cc-26d4-7942-6595a2a18e4b/source/100x100bb.jpg", "artistViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/bumble-holding-limited/id1120675060?uo=4", "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "advisories": ["Frequent/Intense Mature/Suggestive Themes"], "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5s-iPhone5s", "iPadAir-iPadAir", "iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular", "iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina", "iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular", "iPhone6-iPhone6", "iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus", "iPadAir2-iPadAir2", "iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular", "iPadMini3-iPadMini3", "iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular", "iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen", "iPhone6s-iPhone6s", "iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus", "iPadMini4-iPadMini4", "iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular", "iPadPro-iPadPro", "iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular", "iPadPro97-iPadPro97", "iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular", "iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE", "iPhone7-iPhone7", "iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus", "iPad611-iPad611", "iPad612-iPad612", "iPad71-iPad71", "iPad72-iPad72", "iPad73-iPad73", "iPad74-iPad74", "iPhone8-iPhone8", "iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus", "iPhoneX-iPhoneX", "iPad75-iPad75", "iPad76-iPad76", "iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS", "iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax", "iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR", "iPad812-iPad812", "iPad834-iPad834", "iPad856-iPad856", "iPad878-iPad878", "iPadMini5-iPadMini5", "iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular", "iPadAir3-iPadAir3", "iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular", "iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen", "iPhone11-iPhone11", "iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro", "iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen", "iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular", "iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"], "kind": "software", "features": [], "trackCensoredName": "Bumble - Meet New People", "languageCodesISO2A": ["ZH", "DA", "NL", "EN", "FI", "FR", "DE", "HI", "IT", "JA", "KO", "NB", "PL", "PT", "RU", "ES", "SV", "ZH"], "fileSizeBytes": "117044224", "sellerUrl": "http://bumble.com/", "contentAdvisoryRating": "17+", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.0, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion": 5583, "trackViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bumble-meet-new-people/id930441707?uo=4", "trackContentRating": "17+", "sellerName": "Bumble Holding Limited", "formattedPrice": "Free", "trackId": 930441707, "trackName": "Bumble - Meet New People", "releaseNotes": "Bugs and performance fixes.

Whether you\u2019re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\nBumble Bizz: Now we\u2019re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we\u2019ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n\u201cBumble exists to empower women...\u201d (Fast Company)\n\u201cBumble is just an app: but it\u2019s changing the discussion.\u201d (Wired)\n\u201cBumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:\u201d (UK Sunday Times)\n\u201cBumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app\u201d (Texas Standard)\n\u201cWhat makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. \u201d (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use, and that will never change for our main features.

Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \n\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\n\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\n\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\n\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\n\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!

It's not all fun and games though: Now you also have to cook delicious donuts every day for all of the crazy customers in this carnival-like town.\n\nYou'll need to prepare donuts using a variety of doughs and shapes, then toss them in the fryer and cook both sides until they're just right.  Finish the delicious donuts with tasty fillings, icing, and toppings before serving them to your hungry customers.

"NOTE: A device with at least 1 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game\u2019s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2018s is frightening. It\u2019s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It\u2019s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\n#MadeWithFusion", "bundleId": "com.scottgames.fivenights", "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 33037}, "951627425": {"screenshotUrls": ["https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ac/21/73/ac21739e-a26b-d926-c927-7301e0a66f24/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/c3/52/2c/c3522c18-27b2-2d9a-db0a-16a43fc8dd1d/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/20/c5/ce/20c5ce79-4bea-1ee8-a19b-d6a429554a65/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"], "ipadScreenshotUrls": ["https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/44/b6/39/44b63902-5de2-5cba-9873-3f3da3da3167/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/86/00/fd/8600fd40-b4d3-9ca2-93d6-93e9adc9fae0/pr_source.jpg/576x768bb.jpg", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/eb/96/bd/eb96bd17-5ebe-06e8-3fc0-8bd1fe226899/pr_source.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"], "appletvScreenshotUrls": [], "artworkUrl60": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/21/66/cd/2166cd34-344d-3aba-019f-d2266e5ec971/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl512": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/21/66/cd/2166cd34-344d-3aba-019f-d2266e5ec971/source/512x512bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/21/66/cd/2166cd34-344d-3aba-019f-d2266e5ec971/source/100x100bb.jpg", "artistViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/bandai-namco-entertainment-inc/id352305770?uo=4", "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "advisories": ["Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence"], "supportedDevices": ["iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi", "iPad23G-iPad23G", "iPhone4S-iPhone4S", "iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen", "iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G", "iPhone5-iPhone5", "iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen", "iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G", "iPadMini-iPadMini", "iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G", "iPhone5c-iPhone5c", "iPhone5s-iPhone5s", "iPadAir-iPadAir", "iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular", "iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina", "iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular", "iPhone6-iPhone6", "iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus", "iPadAir2-iPadAir2", "iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular", "iPadMini3-iPadMini3", "iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular", "iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen", "iPhone6s-iPhone6s", "iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus", "iPadMini4-iPadMini4", "iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular", "iPadPro-iPadPro", "iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular", "iPadPro97-iPadPro97", "iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular", "iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE", "iPhone7-iPhone7", "iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus", "iPad611-iPad611", "iPad612-iPad612", "iPad71-iPad71", "iPad72-iPad72", "iPad73-iPad73", "iPad74-iPad74", "iPhone8-iPhone8", "iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus", "iPhoneX-iPhoneX", "iPad75-iPad75", "iPad76-iPad76", "iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS", "iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax", "iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR", "iPad812-iPad812", "iPad834-iPad834", "iPad856-iPad856", "iPad878-iPad878", "Watch4-Watch4", "iPadMini5-iPadMini5", "iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular", "iPadAir3-iPadAir3", "iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular", "iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen", "iPhone11-iPhone11", "iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro", "Watch5-Watch5", "iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen", "iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular", "iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"], "kind": "software", "features": ["iosUniversal"], "trackCensoredName": "DRAGON BALL Z DOKKAN BATTLE", "languageCodesISO2A": ["EN", "FR", "KO", "ZH"], "fileSizeBytes": "398157824", "contentAdvisoryRating": "9+", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion": 458, "trackViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dragon-ball-z-dokkan-battle/id951627425?uo=4", "trackContentRating": "9+", "trackName": "DRAGON BALL Z DOKKAN BATTLE", "sellerName": "BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc.", "primaryGenreId": 6014, "formattedPrice": "Free", "minimumOsVersion": "8.0", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled": true, "trackId": 951627425, "releaseDate": "2015-07-16T02:59:25Z", "primaryGenreName": "Games", "genreIds": ["6014", "7012", "7001", "6016"], "currentVersionReleaseDate": "2019-10-08T05:50:17Z", "releaseNotes": "4.5.2\n- Increased the speed of map-related animations.\n- Increased the maximum number of items that can be held.\n- Increased the maximum number of gifts that can be accepted in one go.\n- Increased the types of items that can be exchanged for Trade Pts. at Baba\u2019s Shop.\n- Fixed some bugs.", "currency": "USD", "version": "4.5.2", "wrapperType": "software", "artistId": 352305770, "artistName": "BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc.", "genres": ["Games", "Puzzle", "Action", "Entertainment"], "price": 0.0, "description": "The best Dragon Ball Z battle experience is here!

IPHONE 11 UPDATE\n\nThis update takes full advantage of iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nIPHONE 11 PRO: A TACTILE LENS SWITCHER\nWe've come up with a fast, intuitive way to switch between the Wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras on the iPhone Pro. Of course you can just tap on the lens button in the lower right to cycle through your options, as you've done before. Now you can also Haptic-Touch the button to bring up your choices.\n\nWhat makes our switcher really unique is that once you're familiar with the menu, you can press-and-flick from the lens button to quickly change lenses. We think this is a fast, natural way to switch lenses, and you'll dig how it feels.\n\nTry swiping up from the switcher to go directly to the 2x lens, or swipe left to get that ultra-wide view on iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nIPHONE 11 PRO: LENS GUIDES\n\nWith three cameras, you have even more composition options than ever. With this freedom comes more choices, and our lens guides are here to help you out. \n\nWhen you tap and hold to open our lens switcher, we show guides in the viewfinder to help you visualize what would get cropped at each focal length.\n\nWIDE ANGLE DEPTH\n\nOn both iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, you can now capture depth with the wide angle lens! Just tap the depth button, and then tap the lens button as before.\n\nSMART RAW GOES TO 11\n\nThis update features our first version of Smart RAW for iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. Expect us to tweak this in the future to get even better RAW files from these amazing cameras. \n\nNOTE: \n\nYou may notice that the ultra wide camera does not support manual focus or RAW capture. This is not a bug. The ultra wide camera has fixed focus. At this time, iOS does not support RAW on that camera. If that changes in the future, we'll absolutely update Halide to support it.\n\nAND MUCH MORE (ALSO FOR NON-IPHONE 11!)\n\nDon\u2019t fret, non-upgraders: we have you covered too. This update brings minor fixes and enhancements for all phones including a whopping speed increase for viewing RAW files in the reviewer. \n\nIf you have any feedback about Halide or run into bugs, we're always listening and ready to help. The best way to contact us is support@halide.cam \u2014 comments, questions and praise are always welcome. \n\nDon't forget to tag your photos #ShotWithHalide to be featured on our Instagram!\n\n\u2014Ben & Sebastiaan", "trackId": 885697368, "trackName": "Halide Camera", "primaryGenreName": "Photo & Video", "genreIds": ["6008", "6002"], "formattedPrice": "$5.99", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled": true, "sellerName": "Lux Optics LLC", "currency": "USD", "version": "1.14.1", "wrapperType": "software", "artistId": 885697371, "artistName": "Lux Optics LLC", "genres": ["Photo & Video", "Utilities"], "price": 5.99, "description": "Halide is an award-winning camera app listed in Macworld's \"Must Have Apps,\" The Verge's \"Apps We Love,\" and picked by The Sweet Setup as \"Best Third-Party Camera App for iPhone.\" Daring Fireball says, \u201cThis sort of maniacal attention to the smallest of details deserves to be celebrated.\u201d\n\nHalide is a groundbreaking app for deliberate and thoughtful photography.

This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby\u2019s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. \n\n'I found it in a nano second. It is very very quick to pick it up' Charlotte Hall, 36w\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 71 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's heartbeat and other sounds - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n'Found him or her very quickly very easy to find :)' - Katie, 26w\n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's sounds and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nIt may take time to find, and depends on the position of your baby so you'll need to stick with it and be patient. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 30-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with HMB and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the \u201cBuy App\u201d arrow on the iTunes\u00ae App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your baby heartbeat.\n\n**** Works Beautifully From 27 Weeks ****\nIt is possible (but less likely) to hear from as early as 16-20 weeks, best results are most often achieved as the baby gets larger.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best results\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to follow the instructions for HMB to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive in the heartbeat range.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\nX, Xs, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - we wouldn't wish to claim otherwise. Under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong with your baby :)- Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA or any other medical authority. This is not a medical device. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp", "bundleId":

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. \n\nDISCLAIMER\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* You can be a goat \n* Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \n* MILLIONS OF BUGS!

(..) Pretty useful in extremely dark conditions.\u201d\n\nNeuralCam is the Night Mode camera app for your iPhone. Shoot vivid, brighter and clearer images in low light conditions, with no tripod or other equipment needed.\n\nNeuralCam blends computational photography and machine learning to bring the most out of your low-light shots.\n\nHow it works:\n- Open the app and hold your camera steady for a few seconds as you take the photo.\n- NeuralCam captures a varying number of frames and uses advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning to intelligently merge the frames and brighten the colours to obtain a single high-quality image.\n- Image processing completes in a few seconds (this might vary depending on your device type).\n- The result: a clearer, brighter, sharper, more defined, and colourful image.\n- Swipe down on the photo to go back to camera view\n\nNeuralCam - Night Camera helps you shoot:\n- Beautiful photos in the dark\n- Night selfies without using flash\n- Macros in low light settings\n- Ultra-Wide landscapes at night\n\nTag your photos with the #neuralcam hashtag or send us your best shots at hello@neural.cam to get featured on our social channels.

This really is like magic.\n- This app is hands-down the best low light app I\u2019ve ever used on iOS, and the most similar to Google\u2019s NightSight.\n\nTechnical details:\n- The app works on iPhone 6 and newer devices, running iOS 12 or newer.

"Things get messy when you\u2019re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa\u2019s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that\u2019s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.", "bundleId": "com.flipline.papaspizzeriatogo", "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 216}, "634158738": {"artistViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/rick-meyers/id567008122?uo=4", "artworkUrl60": "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/41/34/61/41346162-b599-6789-7e4b-3d85af1c8e1a/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/41/34/61/41346162-b599-6789-7e4b-3d85af1c8e1a/source/100x100bb.jpg", "screenshotUrls": ["https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/fc/f7/4d/fcf74d93-7345-0a59-64c7-b7dc9550bedd/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5d/d0/ae/5dd0ae2a-7828-093f-b833-faf0d64ea140/mzl.vymqellz.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/21/5b/e3/215be31f-91a2-2e2a-893e-a50a55f5e0c8/mzl.uxjbeeoq.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/80/eb/17/80eb1706-fded-11c8-eeb7-7a4156a2324c/mzl.uohquvis.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/0a/8b/e4/0a8be42b-2796-b535-f3c2-4c5ca9e2d322/mzl.zdzvvyeu.png/392x696bb.png"], "ipadScreenshotUrls": [], "appletvScreenshotUrls": [], "artworkUrl512": "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/41/34/61/41346162-b599-6789-7e4b-3d85af1c8e1a/source/512x512bb.jpg", "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "advisories": [], "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5-iPhone5", "iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen", "iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone5c-iPhone5c", "iPhone5s-iPhone5s", "iPadAir-iPadAir", "iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular", "iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina", "iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular", "iPhone6-iPhone6", "iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus", "iPadAir2-iPadAir2", "iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular", "iPadMini3-iPadMini3", "iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular", "iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen", "iPhone6s-iPhone6s", "iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus", "iPadMini4-iPadMini4", "iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular", "iPadPro-iPadPro", "iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular", "iPadPro97-iPadPro97", "iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular", "iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE", "iPhone7-iPhone7", "iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus", "iPad611-iPad611", "iPad612-iPad612", "iPad71-iPad71", "iPad72-iPad72", "iPad73-iPad73", "iPad74-iPad74", "iPhone8-iPhone8", "iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus", "iPhoneX-iPhoneX", "iPad75-iPad75", "iPad76-iPad76", "iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS", "iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax", "iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR", "iPad812-iPad812", "iPad834-iPad834", "iPad856-iPad856", "iPad878-iPad878", "iPadMini5-iPadMini5", "iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular", "iPadAir3-iPadAir3", "iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular", "iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen", "iPhone11-iPhone11", "iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro", "iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen", "iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular", "iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"], "kind": "software", "features": [], "contentAdvisoryRating": "4+", "trackCensoredName": "e-Sword LT: Bible Study to Go", "languageCodesISO2A": ["EN", "PT", "ES"], "fileSizeBytes": "23616512", "sellerUrl": "https://www.e-sword.net/iphone/", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 5.0, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion": 9, "trackViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/e-sword-lt-bible-study-to-go/id634158738?uo=4", "trackContentRating": "4+", "sellerName": "Richard Meyers", "primaryGenreId": 6006, "releaseDate": "2013-04-20T07:00:00Z", "releaseNotes": "* New Maximize When Scrolling option!

This means that any shortcuts you created in the past will need to be rebuilt.\n\u2022 We now have four official Things actions in the Shortcuts app: Add To-Do, Show To-Do, Show List, and Run Things URL.\n\u2022 You can go to Settings > Siri & Shortcuts to find some tips on how to create your first shortcuts.\n\u2022 Note that the old Workflow action \u201cAdd Things To-Do\u201d is still visible in the Shortcuts app, but you should avoid it completely (it will eventually be removed).\n\nNEW SHARE EXTENSION\nOur extension for sharing stuff into Things from other apps was previously an Action Extension (in the Share Sheet\u2019s row of grey buttons); we\u2019ve now converted it into a Share Extension, and you\u2019ll find it in the row of colored app icons instead.\n\u2022 It now looks like the in-app new to-do popover.\n\u2022 You can now choose the target list for your new to-do.\n\nSYSTEM DARK MODE\nThe OS now has a system-wide setting for Dark Mode and we\u2019ve added full support for it. This means our toggle based on screen brightness has been removed and Things now adapts to the system-wide setting (unless you set Things\u2019 mode manually, which is still possible).\n\nNEW GESTURES\nThings supports the new text gestures on iOS 13. These gestures make it easier to select, copy, and paste; you can also undo typing with a swipe. See Apple\u2019s documentation for more info.\n\nREMINDERS INBOX\nApple\u2019s Reminders app has changed quite a bit this year. We\u2019ve reworked the existing feature for adding to-dos to Things\u2019 Inbox; it\u2019s now called \u201cReminders Inbox\u201d in Settings.\n\nREMINDERS IMPORT\nWe\u2019ve also built a new \u201cReminders Import\u201d feature for users who want to migrate their entire Reminders database over to Things. You\u2019ll find this feature in Settings > Import.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\nThings now has improved support for Voice Over and the new Voice Control feature \u2013 especially for navigating and scrolling lists, editing to-dos, and reordering to-dos.", "primaryGenreName": "Productivity", "genreIds": ["6007", "6000"], "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled": true, "currency": "USD", "version": "3.10.5", "wrapperType": "software", "artistId": 284971784, "artistName": "Cultured Code GmbH & Co. KG", "genres": ["Productivity", "Business"], "price": 6.99, "description": "*** APPLE DESIGN AWARD WINNER 2017 ***\n\nMeet the all-new Things! A complete rethinking of the original, award-winning task manager \u2013 with a perfect balance between simplicity and power, incredible new features, delightful interactions, and a timeless new design.\n\n\nHERE'S HOW THINGS WORKS\n\nIf you're new to Things, this is the basic workflow:\n\n1. Collect Your Thoughts\nGet things off your mind quickly with Things\u2019 action extension \u2013 it lets you create to-dos from other apps. Or just talk to Siri on any device (\u201cRemind me to...\u201d) and import from Reminders.\n\n2. Get Organized\nCreate a project for each of your goals, then add the steps to reach them. For clarity, add structure with headings. Then group your projects by areas of responsibility, such as \u201cFamily\u201d, \u201cWork\u201d, or \u201cHealth\u201d. Review these regularly to stay on top of things.\n\n3. Plan Your Time\nSee your calendar events alongside your to-dos and plan your time effectively. Create repeating to-dos for things you do every few days, weeks, or months \u2013 Things will remind you on the right day.\n\n4. Make the Most of Your Day\nEvery morning, grab a coffee and prepare your list for \u201cToday\u201d: review previously planned to-dos and make quick decisions on what to tackle. Pick some more steps from your projects and then get going. The Today list is the only place you\u2019ll need to look for the rest of the day.\n\n5. Customize Your Workflow\nUse tags to categorize your to-dos or add context. For example, tag places like \u201cOffice\u201d or \u201cHome\u201d, or tag all your \u201cErrands\u201d, or everything you\u2019re working on with \u201cKate\u201d. You can easily find everything you\u2019ve tagged via filtering or search.\n\n\nHERE'S WHY WE THINK YOU'LL LOVE THINGS\n\n1. It stays out of your way.\nAs you start using Things, you\u2019ll quickly notice how seamlessly all the features fit together to give you an uncluttered, focused experience. There are no unnecessary frills. No pointless gimmicks or useless controls. In fact, you\u2019ll hardly notice the app \u2013 it\u2019s just you and your to-dos.\n\n2. Everything revolves around your to-dos.\nIn Things, each of your to-dos are special. In a list, they simply show a checkbox and the title of your to-do. But when you open them, they extend into a beautiful white piece of paper that\u2019s ready to hold your thoughts. Additional details (checklists, tags, reminders, deadline) are nicely tucked away in the corner until you need them.\n\n3. It\u2019s got a touch of magic.\nThings removes friction in magical ways. Take the new Magic Plus Button that lets you insert to-dos at any place in a list \u2013 simply via drag and drop. Or the ease at which you can multi-select and operate on many to-dos at once. Or the natural language date parser: just type \u201ctomorrow\u201d, \u201cin 4 days\", or \u201cnext Wednesday\", and it will jump to all the right conclusions.\n\n4. It\u2019s got all the power of iOS.\nThings is fully integrated with all the latest iOS technologies: Apple Watch, Calendars, Siri & Reminders, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Handoff, and Notifications.\n\n5. And much more...\nEveryone's got their favorite feature, it's impossible to list them all. See what our users love about Things \u2013 visit our website at: thingsapp.com\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEW?\n\nThis is a truly incredible update, with dozens of powerful new features. See the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section below for a full list.\n\n\nTHINGS FOR ALL YOUR DEVICES\n\nGet Things for Mac and iPad to enjoy the full power of Things across your devices (sold separately). The apps all stay updated via Things Cloud \u2013 the push sync service that we custom-built for Things.\n\n\nQUESTIONS?\n\nIf you have any questions, or run into any trouble \u2013 please contact us.

No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out.\n\n\u2022 QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n\u2022 OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n\u2022 AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply.

Top 5 in Health & Fitness in 63 countries. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*IMPORTANT* \nHeartWatch 3 requires iOS 10 or iOS 11. Watch OS 3 or Watch OS 4.\nIf you are missing the Watch App or Experiencing crash on restart, please press the Review tab and click on App Support. This explains what you need to do! Please email us if you are stuck. We love to help. \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nYour Apple Watch is a highly sophisticated instrument, measuring and capturing your heart rate data throughout the day.\n\nHeartWatch lets you see how your heart is beating across four simple views. Waking, Regular, Workout & Sleeping. Each of these views are isolated because, while you may want a higher heart rate during a workout, if your heart is racing when you aren't doing any exercise then this is likely not a good thing and probably something you might want to show your medical practitioner. \n\nHeartWatch gives you an easy solution to this. It accesses your heart rate & workout readings created by your Apple Watch and unlocks the power of this information in a simple, intuitive way. \n\nINTRODUCING HEART BADGES\nHeartWatch 2 introduces heart badges. These are a simple glanceable graphic that lets you quickly see how your heart is doing for different types of events. The colours represent time in zones overlayed with an average. \n\nFor regular* heart rate readings, the ideal is to have a completely blue badge. The bigger the red ring around the badge, the more time spent with an elevated heart rate. Even though averages can appear to be similar, the badge shows a clear picture of how your heart has really been tracking and alerts you about excessively high or low readings. \n\nFor workouts, you can easily see the zonal makeup of your workout at a glance.\n\n*regular: time spent not sleeping nor working out.\n\nAN INTELLIGENT COMPLICATION\nThe complication displays the last heart rate reading captured by your watch. \n\nA FAST, EASY TO USE WATCH APP\nAn instant background update has you seeing your latest heart rate and a summary of your day. You can take your \"live\" pulse at any time by tapping the Pulse gauge. You can start a workout directly in the app and get live updates on your heart rate zone. You can also track sleep and add measurements & notes. \n\nAMAZING NAVIGATION\nWhether you are looking for heart rate irregularities or checking on your workout progress, HeartWatch makes things very easy via a 12 week big picture. Find out exactly what your heart was doing throughout your day. The addition of an energy overlay to the regular heart rate detail view means you can determine if those peaks you sometimes get are more likely due to stress or increased activity. \n\nCAPTURE HEALTH & SLEEP DATA\nCapture key HealthKit measurements just by saying them, take notes about your day and track sleep.\n\nNOTIFICATIONS\nYou can configure notifications for the following scenarios. \n - When heart rate exceeds a bpm value. \n - When heart rate drops below a bpm value. \n - A daily reminder to check how you've gone today. \n\nNOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HEALTH\nHeart Watch is very useful tool to get alerted about any possible health issues in a concise format that you can show your medical practitioner.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nThis app requires an iPhone that has the Health App installed. Heart readings are read from the Health Data Store which is ideally populated by your Apple Watch. You can also import heart rate readings from other sources and devices.", "artistId": 861650887, "artistName": "Tantsissa", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 2.99, "bundleId": "com.tantsissa.Heartbeat", "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 5669}, "556500145": {"isGameCenterEnabled": false, "screenshotUrls": ["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/4c/d9/8c/4cd98cca-7187-23eb-37fc-de68abbd5473/pr_source.png/406x228bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5d/94/b9/5d94b976-4981-32f6-9e60-78dc45e54a36/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a6/0c/6f/a60c6f00-a34b-1308-22c9-6918d8bdb3ac/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5d/02/a3/5d02a3e4-4501-b8df-2cb3-c341b1b50d81/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png", "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/c4/7e/ad/c47eadd9-cc83-adb6-bd99-8e0e4b91034c/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"], "ipadScreenshotUrls": ["https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c8/68/cf/c868cf71-e9c2-9680-0c36-797ae06128da/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png", "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/4e/6e/b5/4e6eb542-307d-002a-299f-b4205cb437de/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png", "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/20/1b/34/201b344d-7245-e42b-2eb7-687fc0e650d4/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png", "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/b9/01/67/b9016734-be37-195a-ca47-faa7e123ae87/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png", "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/26/86/46/2686466a-aafc-2383-0f3b-8a21384cf8af/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"], "appletvScreenshotUrls": [], "artworkUrl60": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7d/fc/2f/7dfc2f7c-62f2-86f5-6b2b-10ea5a47e109/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl512": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7d/fc/2f/7dfc2f7c-62f2-86f5-6b2b-10ea5a47e109/source/512x512bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7d/fc/2f/7dfc2f7c-62f2-86f5-6b2b-10ea5a47e109/source/100x100bb.jpg", "artistViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/appxy/id760100924?uo=4", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5-iPhone5", "iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen", "iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone5c-iPhone5c", "iPhone5s-iPhone5s", "iPadAir-iPadAir", "iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular", "iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina", "iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular", "iPhone6-iPhone6", "iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus", "iPadAir2-iPadAir2", "iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular", "iPadMini3-iPadMini3", "iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular", "iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen", "iPhone6s-iPhone6s", "iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus", "iPadMini4-iPadMini4", "iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular", "iPadPro-iPadPro", "iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular", "iPadPro97-iPadPro97", "iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular", "iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE", "iPhone7-iPhone7", "iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus", "iPad611-iPad611", "iPad612-iPad612", "iPad71-iPad71", "iPad72-iPad72", "iPad73-iPad73", "iPad74-iPad74", "iPhone8-iPhone8", "iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus", "iPhoneX-iPhoneX", "iPad75-iPad75", "iPad76-iPad76", "iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS", "iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax", "iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR", "iPad812-iPad812", "iPad834-iPad834", "iPad856-iPad856", "iPad878-iPad878", "iPadMini5-iPadMini5", "iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular", "iPadAir3-iPadAir3", "iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular", "iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen", "iPhone11-iPhone11", "iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro", "iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen", "iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular", "iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"], "advisories": [], "kind": "software", "features": ["iosUniversal"], "trackCensoredName": "Tiny Scanner Pro", "languageCodesISO2A": ["EN", "FR", "DE", "IT", "JA", "PT", "RU", "ZH", "ES", "SV"], "fileSizeBytes": "84972544", "contentAdvisoryRating": "4+", "trackViewUrl": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-scanner-pro/id556500145?uo=4", "trackContentRating": "4+", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled": true, "currentVersionReleaseDate": "2019-10-23T18:25:26Z", "releaseNotes": "Other than minor bug fixes and improvements, we also:\n- Fixed few crashes happened on iOS 10.\n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback!

As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n\u2022 A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n\u2022 Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n\u2022 Earn rewards and unlock more than 30 new tree species and white noises.\n\u2022 Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n\u2022 Plant trees along with friends & family.\n\u2022 Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n\u2022 Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\u2022 Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n\u2022 Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n\u2022 Track your focused time in the Apple HealthKit.\n\u2022 Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n\u2022 Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n\u2022 Due to iOS system limitations, we cannot determine what app the user is currently using, thus the whitelist feature cannot be implemented. If you wish to access other apps without affecting the growth of your tree, you can turn off \"Deep Focus Mode\". Thank you for your understanding and sorry for any inconvenience.\n\u2022 Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n\u2022 There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.95
